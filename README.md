# Farol

Farol is an experimental, open-source project with the goal of developing a free software verifier. The ultimate aim is to work towards compatibility with the CProver family (such as CBMC and ESBMC), though this is expected to take several years of development.

At present, Farol is focused on research and laying foundational groundwork for CProver techniques.

## Development

- Use any C compiler to build `nob.c` and execute it, e.g.: `gcc nob.c -o nob && nob`.
- Farol will be inside `build/farol`.

Descriptions and issues are tracked on `doc.org`.

## Project Milestones

1. **Parse GOTO programs** generated by CBMC and ESBMC.
2. **Interpret GOTO programs** to enable analysis and execution (probably with gccjit).
3. **Modify and export** GOTO programs in a compatible format.
4. **Design a symbolic execution engine** that allows users to define custom proof strategies via an embedded scripting language like Lua.
5. **Integrate SMT solvers** for constraint solving and verification (incremental and full formula).

## Important Note

If you are looking for a mature and fully featured software verifier today, you should go for ESBMC/CBMC.
